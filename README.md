# split_check_app_swiftUI

Project 1 of the 100-day SWIFTUI challenge by Paul Hudson. 

Today I completed the first #SwiftUI project from the #100daysofSwiftUI course by Paul Hudson. I highly recommend this challenge, it is well-explained and made for Engineers who are interested in learning the foundations of SwiftUI but don't know where to start. The first project is a simple check-sharing app which calculates how to split a check based on the number of people (I gave it a "Dark Side" touch though).

In this course, I learned about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build forms and sections, creating navigation views and navigation bar titles, how to store program state with the @State property wrapper, create user interface controls like TextField and Picker, and views in a loop using ForEach.

I'm absolutely loving SwiftUI and amazed at how such a small amount of clean code can create a sleek and modern view.
